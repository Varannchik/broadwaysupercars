                    Broadway SuperClub membership is the right choice. </p>
                <p>Imagine having a fleet of hand crafted motor cars at your disposal. Slide into the fine leather driver’s seat of an exquisite driving machine after a hard day’s work. See the pavement flying beneath your wheels, hear the engine purring in your ears, and feel the stress melting away.</p>
                <p>Why not surprise and impress your clients by providing them with a superior, high-performance supercar to use during their visit? Or send one of our classy, sophisticated automobiles with a chauffeur to drive them around town.</p>

				<p>Variety is the spice of life, and driving the same car day in and day out is borrr-ing! With a
                    Broadway SuperClub membership you can choose any car you want to drive from our super fleet. Drive a Ferrari, a Lamborghini,
                    an Aston Martin, a Jaguar, a Bentley, or one of the other cars in our collection whenever you like. Purchasing a Broadway
                    SuperClub membership is like buying an entire fleet of luxury, exotic automobiles.</p>

Driving guests of the Designee(s) also deplete the shared pool by one driving pass/day/person, and guests (non‐members) are limited to driving twice/season. A Corporate Member may add Designees (above the initial 5) for an additional initiation fee and annual dues. Designees may be added, deleted, or changed each season by the Corporate Member.</p>

                <p>Owning, storing, and maintaining a SuperCar can be cost prohibitive. A SuperClub membership provides the same benefits of owning an exotic car, with none of the draw backs. Compare the cost of owning a SuperCar versus our SuperClub membership and you’ll understand what a bargain a SuperClub membership can be.
