                            <p>If you already have an existing insurance policy on a personal vehicle you own or lease, you can use this same policy to cover your rental vehicle. We will contact your insurance company to verify that you have adequatecoverage in place. If your coverage is insufficient, we will require all driver(s) to purchase additional coverage with their insurance company prior to renting. (Fortunately, it does not matter what car you drive personally. Aslong as you have insurance in good standing, your carrier will cover damages.). Out-of-state renters are required to maintain full-coverage insurance (liability, comprehensive, and collision).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Third Party Insurance</p>
                            <p>If you are unable to provide your own insurance based on the two options outlined above, there are 3rd-party insurance companies that provide damage waiver products/services.

We offer a 24 hour grace period after booking your reservation to make changes or cancel your reservationfor a 100% refund. If you need to cancel your reservation within 7 days of your rental date, there will be a fee of 50% of the total rental cost, meaning you will only be refunded half initial amount you were charged. If you no-showat the time of your reservation without notifying us ahead of time, you will be charged a cancellation fee of 100% of the total rental cost.
                    Please understand there are no exceptions to this cancellation policy. We do not mean to sound heartless, but the day you rented the vehicle will now become an empty slot and we have other people who may have wanted thedate of your reservation.
                </p>
                <div class="clear10"></div>

                <span class="blue_title">WEATHER POLICY</span>
                <p>Unfortunately we cannot control the weather, but we try to be understanding and flexible when the weather isn’t cooperating. If you’re unable to use the vehicle during your rental period, we may (at our discretion) be willing toreschedule your rental for another day at no additional charge. This policy is not to be abused – if it's lightly raining or cloudy, we’ll expect you to pick up the car. However, if there’s a severe, inclement weather forecast, we valueyour safety and will work with you to make an alternative rental arrangement. The same applies while you are in possession of the car. If you are unable to use or return the vehicle due to unsafe driving conditions caused by theweather, you may be able to extend your rental at no additional charge. Again, these extensions are subjective and we will expect to discuss them with you – at no time are you to assume you can keep the car.</p>
                <div class="clear10"></div>

                <span class="blue_title">FUEL POLICY</span>
                <p>Broadway Supercars LLC delivers all rental vehicles with a full tank of gas. Renters are expected to return them re-fueled. All vehicles MUST be fueled with Premium Grade 91+ octane gasoline. There are fees for refueling the carwith anything other than 91+ grade gasoline. Lower fuel grades can severely damage the vehicle’s engine. If you decide not to return the car with a full tank, you will be subject to re-fueling fees which will be taken from yoursecurity deposit on file.</p>
                <div class="clear10"></div>

                <span class="blue_title">REFUND POLICY / MECHANICAL BREAKDOWN</span>
                <p>We do our very best to work with our customers and want to make sure you are satisfied 100% with your driving experience. We do not offer refunds for gift certificates or vouchers purchased from any social media sources. Ourweather policy (mentioned above) is one of two refund exceptions. The second is in the event of an unforeseen mechanical failure during or prior to a rental (driver must not be at fault). There’s a big difference between runningthe vehicle hard and abuse. We encourage all drivers to safely enjoy themselves and let the engine stretch its’ legs. But, If you are cruising at 9000 RPM’s for an hour without shifting and the car breaks down, you are most likely atfault. In the event of a not-at-fault breakdown, we will make every effort to get the car back on the road and/or will credit you for the time and miles you were not able to use by giving you the option to receive a pro-rated refundpayment or credit towards a future rental.</p>
